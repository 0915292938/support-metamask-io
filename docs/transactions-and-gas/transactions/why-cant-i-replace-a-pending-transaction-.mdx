#### Looking for how to resolve pending transactions?

Pending transactions that are displaying as such on the blockchain (make sure to [check a block explorer](/managing-my-wallet/how-to-check-my-wallet-activity-on-the-blockchain-explorer)) can be replaced by sending another transaction with the same nonce, using the method [here](/transactions-and-gas/transactions/how-to-speed-up-or-cancel-a-pending-transaction). This article should be your first destination if you're looking for how to replace a pending transaction.

One of the most common reasons your replacement pending transaction will fail is because you **already have multiple pending transactions**.

In these cases, you need to **replace the oldest transaction first, and proceed through them in reverse order **(from oldest to newest).

Age is determined by the transaction's nonce, a unique number (_number used only once_) that is assigned to every transaction sent from your wallet. Nonces are assigned in ascending order â€” so the smallest pending transaction nonce you can find is the oldest.

#### How do I find pending transactions?

If a transaction is pending, it will be marked as such in your MetaMask transaction history. You can also inspect your history on a [block explorer](/managing-my-wallet/how-to-check-my-wallet-activity-on-the-blockchain-explorer).

If you try to replace a pending transaction before resolving older outstanding pending transactions first, your new transactions will continually fail. This is because you need to resolve the oldest first.
