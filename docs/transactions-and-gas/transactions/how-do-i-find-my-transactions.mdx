There are a few different ways to locate and view your transactions:

## **Finding transactions in MetaMask**

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Extension" label="Extension">

As soon as you submit a transaction to the network, it will appear in the 'Activity' tab of your account, detailing whether you were sending or receiving:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/transactions-and-gas/transactions/how-do-i-find-my-transactions/MetaMask_view_transaction_activity_extension1.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask view transaction activity extension"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Click on the transaction in question to display its details:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/transactions-and-gas/transactions/how-do-i-find-my-transactions/MetaMask_view_transaction_activity_extension2.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask view transaction activity extension"
    />
  </div>
</div>

From here, you can also get additional information by following the 'View on block explorer' link. 'Copy Transaction ID' will add the transaction hash to your clipboard.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Mobile" label="Mobile">

There are two ways to access your transactions on Mobile.

The first is to tap on the token type whose transactions you want to view, and scroll down:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/transactions-and-gas/transactions/how-do-i-find-my-transactions/MetaMask_view_transaction_activity_mobile_method1.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask view transaction activity mobile method"
    />
  </div>
</div>

The second is to tap the clock icon in tab bar to see your activity. In the transaction list that appears, tap on the transaction you're looking for to view its details.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/transactions-and-gas/transactions/how-do-i-find-my-transactions/MetaMask_view_transaction_activity_mobile_method2.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask view transaction activity mobile method"
    />
  </div>
</div>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="MetaMask Portfolio" label="MetaMask Portfolio">

Your transactions are viewable in your dashboard by switching to the transaction view:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/transactions-and-gas/transactions/how-do-i-find-my-transactions/MetaMask_view_transaction_activity_portfolio1.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask view transaction activity portfolio"
    />
  </div>
</div>

You can click each transaction to view its details:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/transactions-and-gas/transactions/how-do-i-find-my-transactions/MetaMask_view_transaction_activity_portfolio2.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask view transaction activity portfolio"
    />
  </div>
</div>

You can configure the transactions displayed by using the account dropdown on the right:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/transactions-and-gas/transactions/how-do-i-find-my-transactions/MetaMask_view_transaction_activity_portfolio3.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask view transaction activity portfolio"
    />
  </div>
</div>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## **Finding transactions on the block explorer**

### Firstly: what is a block explorer?

Essentially, block explorers are independent sites which retrieve information about activity on the blockchain, organise it, and make it freely available online. With the help of block explorers, all network (blockchain) activity can be quickly queried, helping ensure total transparency.

Although their barrage of [long, hexadecimal numbers](/getting-started/the-ethereum-address-format-and-why-it-matters-when-using-metamask) and highly specific terminology can be intimidating at first, block explorers are very easy to use. These skills will form a vital element in your toolkit for using Web3.

Block explorers are specific to each blockchain: Ethereum has its own ([Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)), BSC has its own ([BscScan](https://bscscan.com/)), etc.

Make sure you're using the right site by heading to the relevant network profile from our [hub](/network-profiles/network-profiles-hub), which covers many of the most popular EVM-compatible blockchains.

### Finding transactions

Although there are distinctions between each block explorer, they broadly look the same. The steps below will apply regardless of the network you're using:

1. Open up the appropriate block explorer. [Network profiles accessible from our hub](/network-profiles/network-profiles-hub) can help you find it.
2. [Copy your wallet address.](/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-to-copy-your-metamask-account-public-address-)
3. Paste your address into the search bar to open up your wallet's page.
4. Locate the transaction in the list provided.
