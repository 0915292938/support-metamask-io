#### Note:

- An important message from the MetaMask team regarding this issue can be found [here](https://community.metamask.io/t/restored-metamask-no-coins-are-showing/878/107?u=jacob.cantele).
- For basic information on your Secret Recovery Phrase in MetaMask, see our user guide [here](/getting-started/user-guide-secret-recovery-phrase-password-and-private-keys).

:::

Assuming you are using the correct Secret Recovery Phrase (which can restore multiple accounts) or private key (which can restore only one account when [imported](/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-to-import-an-account)), it is impossible to restore the wrong account(s). Check to see if any of the following apply to you:

If you are encountering this problem, the most common reasons are:

1. **The Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) you currently have is not the one that restores the account you are looking for. **In other words: you have the wrong SRP.

2. **The account you are missing was a secondary account created under the SRP you currently have.**

   To check if that is the case, use [https://danfinlay.github.io/mnemonic-account-generator/](https://danfinlay.github.io/mnemonic-account-generator/) to generate 10 to 100 accounts and check if the missing accounts are in that list. (Bear in mind that the generator will produce account addresses *without *the 0x at the start, so copying an address from elsewhere that *does *have the 0x prefix will produce no matches.)

   If the account you're looking for is a secondary account, you can recreate it in MetaMask by following the instructions [here](/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-to-add-missing-accounts-after-restoring-with-secret-recovery-phrase).

3. **The SRP you have was originally generated by a different wallet provider.**

   If you think this could be the case, try restoring your account using that wallet to check if you get access to the missing account.

4. **The missing account was imported using a private key.**

   This is what is known as an [imported account](/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/what-are-imported-accounts-). In this case, the only way to access the account is to reimport it using the private key.

5. **The SRP was written down wrong or is being entered incorrectly when restoring.**

   One frequent problem is poor handwriting when writing down the SRP; another is writing the words in the *wrong order. *The words must be in the order in which they were originally presented.

6. **The SRP is actually restoring the account, but what is missing is the custom tokens that need to be re-added. **

   You can follow the steps [here](/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/how-to-display-tokens-in-metamask) to re-add them.
