MetaMask uses passwords in a way that you may not be used to. This mainly has to do with the fact that [MetaMask is a self-custodial wallet](/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet) (also called non-custodial, though we're phasing out this term); it's **not** a conventional cloud-based app where we keep track of your username and password.

**You** keep track of your [Secret Recovery Phrase](/getting-started/user-guide-secret-recovery-phrase-password-and-private-keys), and each time you [restore your wallet using your Secret Recovery Phrase](/managing-my-wallet/resetting-deleting-and-restoring/how-to-restore-your-metamask-wallet-from-secret-recovery-phrase), **_you set the password for that specific instance of MetaMask._**\
**This means that if you use different passwords for each instance** (Mobile, Extension, Extension on different computers or browser profiles), **you need to remember which password you used for each instance.**
