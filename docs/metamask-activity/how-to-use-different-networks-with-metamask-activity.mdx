You can now use MetaMask Activity to review and troubleshoot your transactions on numerous EVM-compatible networks, including:

- Polygon
- Binance
- Avalanche
- Arbitrum
- Palm
- Fantom
- Cronos.

You can only view transactions on **one network at a time**.

You can manually select the network for which you'd like to check your transactions by using the network selector, located next to the account address:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/metamask-activity/how-to-use-different-networks-with-metamask-activity/MMA_use_different_networks.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Activity use different networks"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Please note that MetaMask Activity will behave differently depending on whether you have _connected your wallet_ or whether you've _looked up_ an account:

- **If you've connected your wallet, MetaMask Activity will detect your currently selected network in MetaMask** and automatically display transactions on those networks â€” so in a lot of cases, you shouldn't have to switch manually. If your currently selected network is unsupported by MetaMask Activity, Ethereum mainnet will be selected by default.
- **If you've searched by account address (or ENS name), MetaMask Activity will default to Ethereum mainnet**. So if you want to view that account's transactions on a different network, you need to switch.
