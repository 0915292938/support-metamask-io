### Known Issues

#### MetaMask doesn 't open when I try to connect, or another crypto wallet opens instead

If you run into a situation where MetaMask won 't open, or a different web3 or crypto wallet extension opens instead when attempting to connect to MetaMask Activity, follow these steps to try and resolve the issue:

1. Verify that MetaMask is installed in your browser, your Secret Recovery Phrase is imported, and that you are able to unlock your wallet using your password. _If you're having problems unlocking your wallet, [start here](/privacy-and-security/passwords-and-metamask); if you need to find your SRP, [start here](/managing-my-wallet/secret-recovery-phrase-and-private-keys/can-i-access-my-accounts-without-my-secret-recovery-phrase)_
2. Verify that you're using one of the browsers listed below.
3. Disable all other wallet extensions (**but make sure you know your passwords and Secret Recovery Phrases for each wallet before you do!**)
4. Create [a separate browser profile for each crypto wallet](/managing-my-wallet/using-metamask/how-to-use-multiple-metamask-wallets)
5. If you're still running into problems, start a conversation with a member of our Support team by going to [support.metamask.io](https://support.metamask.io) and clicking on the big blue button labelled “Start a Conversation”.

### MetaMask Activity is supported on the following browsers:

#### Google Chrome

#### Mozilla Firefox

#### Safari (MacOS and iOS)

- _MetaMask Extension is not available in Safari; however, MetaMask Activity can still be used by entering the ENS name or public address of the account you're interested in. For steps to find and copy a public address from your wallet, _[see here](/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-to-copy-your-metamask-account-public-address-)_. _

It is likely that MetaMask Activity will work as expected on many other browsers, as well, especially those that are Chrome-based, such as Microsoft Edge. Brave Browser, while being Chrome-based, sometimes requires additional configuration in order to work properly with MetaMask; for more on this, [see here](/managing-my-wallet/using-metamask/using-metamask-wallet-in-brave-browser).

### If you have ideas for how we can continue to improve MetaMask Activity, please submit them via the feedback form at the bottom of the MetaMask Activity page.
