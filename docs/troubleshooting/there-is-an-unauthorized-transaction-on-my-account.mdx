If you see a transaction on your account that you do not recognize at first, one of these situations will apply to you:

## The transaction _did_ originate from you

It's entirely possible that you don't recognize a transaction because you forgot you made it, or because it's part of a more complex string of transactions executed whilst you were interacting with a dapp. Using a [block explorer](/managing-my-wallet/how-to-check-my-wallet-activity-on-the-blockchain-explorer), check whether you recognize the following traits of the transaction:

- Date and time
- Recipient address
- The dapp involved (which is listed alongside each transaction under 'Activity')
- The value sent.

## The transaction is unauthorized

If you're sure the transaction is not yours, check out our article *[I've been hacked/scammed](/privacy-and-security/ive-been-hacked-scammed-unauthorized-transactions-on-my-account) *to see our recommended next steps.
