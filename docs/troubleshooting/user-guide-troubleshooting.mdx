If MetaMask isn't working the way you expected, there are some steps you can take on your own that often solve problems, without having to create a support ticket. Here are some of our top fixes:

- Restart your browser, or force close the mobile app and reopen.
- Restart your computer or mobile device.
- [Lock and unlock MetaMask](/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-do-i-log-out-of-lock-my-wallet).
- If your problem relates to a specific transaction, check the relevant block explorer for the network you're using, such as [Etherscan](/managing-my-wallet/how-to-check-my-wallet-activity-on-the-blockchain-explorer). Block explorers are a wealth of information and offer much greater detail regarding the where, when, what, and who of transactions.
- Make sure you're [running the latest version](/managing-my-wallet/using-metamask/how-to-update-the-version-of-metamask) of MetaMask.
- Search the [Community Forums](https://community.metamask.io/) and this Knowledge Base for similar problems.
- **We do not recommend [resetting your wallet](/managing-my-wallet/resetting-deleting-and-restoring/how-to-reset-your-wallet) or [resetting an account](/managing-my-wallet/resetting-deleting-and-restoring/how-to-clear-your-account-activity-reset-account) unless one of our agents advises you to.**
- Remember, [MetaMask is a self-custodial wallet](/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet), which means we **cannot rescue compromised wallets.** We also **cannot** **reverse transactions**, as this contradicts the immutability of blockchain.
- If you're experiencing a problem with a third-party platform, like a [token swapping app](/third-party-platforms-and-dapps/user-guide-dapps) or blockchain videogame,** reach out to their support team first**.
- If you're looking for help, don't spam our Support team by asking the same question on multiple channels. This will only delay the reply. If you have a live conversation open, your browser will remember your history. If you have a live ticket (email correspondence) with our Technical Support team, see how to check on the status of your ticket [here](/getting-started/how-to-check-the-status-of-an-open-support-ticket).
- Have you waited long enough? Blockchain is fast, but not instantaneous. How low did you set your gas? Are you transacting on a layer 2 chain that requires you to wait before removing funds?
- Did you use a bridge? See our [article](/networks-and-sidechains/field-guide-to-bridges) for additional guidance.

If you still need help, open a ticket following our instructions [here](/getting-started/how-to-contact-metamask-support).
