import CustomLayout from "@site/src/layouts/collabHeader";

<CustomLayout />

The following error message can occur when performing a transaction in MetaMask:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/troubleshooting/error-number-to-bn-while-converting-number/metamask_error-bnumber-to-bn.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask error"
    />
  </div>
</div>

In this case, start by reinstalling MetaMask on your device.

**Before you uninstall, make sure you have your Secret Recovery Phrase and seed phrases (or private keys) imported accounts).** You do not need to have your MetaMask password, as you'll have to choose a new one as part of the restore process anyway.

For details on how to restore your account after reinstalling MetaMask, please refer to [this article](/managing-my-wallet/resetting-deleting-and-restoring/how-to-restore-your-metamask-wallet-from-secret-recovery-phrase).
