<CustomLayout />

If you get an error about a token having already been added when trying to add a token, you can solve it through the following process:

1. Right-click on the MetaMask Extension
2. Select 'This Can Read and Change Site Data'
3. Select 'On All Sites' instead of 'When You Click the Extension'

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/troubleshooting/cannot-load-tokens-due-to-error-message-about-token-being-already-added/MetaMask_read_change_data_on_all_sites.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask read and change data on all sites"
    />
  </div>
</div>

You may also need to close and re-open your browser, or try a different internet connection entirely.

Note that this only applies to Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave), and not Firefox. MetaMask Extension on Firefox is configured to request this permission as a requirement of use.

If you continue to experience issues, [please contact MetaMask Support](/getting-started/how-to-contact-metamask-support).
