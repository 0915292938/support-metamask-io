This warning message appears when you attempt to connect your wallet to a site that may be a phishing scam. It will look like this:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/troubleshooting/deceptive-site-ahead-when-trying-to-connect-to-a-site/MetaMask_phishing_detection_screen.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask_phishing_detection_screen.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

**We recommend you don't connect your wallet to sites that trigger this message**.

If you're the owner of the site and believe it has been wrongly marked as a potential scam, please log your case here: [https://github.com/metamask/eth-phishing-detect/issues](https://github.com/metamask/eth-phishing-detect/issues)

One of our team will then review your case as soon as feasible and may whitelist your site depending on their findings.

You can also use [this utility](https://metamask.github.io/eth-phishing-detect/) to check why your domain was blocked, and see [here](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect) for the rationale behind blocklisted sites.
