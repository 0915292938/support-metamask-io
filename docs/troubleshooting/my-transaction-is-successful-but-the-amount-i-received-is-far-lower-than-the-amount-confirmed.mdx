If you have completed a transaction successfully but you've noticed a discrepancy between the amount confirmed in your MetaMask wallet and the amount you received (and displayed in the [block explorer](/managing-my-wallet/how-to-check-my-wallet-activity-on-the-blockchain-explorer)), please check if the token you received is subject to a "tax".

As an example, a 10% tax applies on SAFEMOON transactions, and OKTA transactions are subject to an 8% tax.

For further details please refer to the token issuer documentation.

If you want to read more about potential reasons why your tokens aren't displaying correctly, see our articles [here](/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/a-token-is-missing-from-my-wallet).
