Generally speaking, "Exception is thrown in contract code" means exactly what it says — something in the contract didn't work correctly. Since this means there's a problem or some dysfunction in the smart contract — an area over which we have no control — we're unable to assist you.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/troubleshooting/error-exception-is-thrown-in-contract-code-in-contract-execution/MetaMask_exception_thrown_error.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask exception thrown error"
    />
  </div>
</div>

In these cases, please contact the owners of the contract for resolution or advice. The developers should post in our forum and/or on the Ethereum stack exchange to seek help.
