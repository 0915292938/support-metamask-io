This error message can be prompted because:

- You are using the wrong token address. Check [here](/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/how-to-find-a-token-contract-address) for guidance on how to find it.
- MetaMask needs to be [updated to the latest version.](/managing-my-wallet/using-metamask/how-to-update-the-version-of-metamask)

If these steps do not solve this issue, try reinstalling the app. Make sure you have everything backed up before proceeding: your Secret Recovery Phrase, private keys (for any imported accounts), and passwords.

**_Do not _**uninstall the app if you don't have your Secret Recovery Phrase backed up and safely recorded somewhere, otherwise you will permanently lose access to your wallet. Since MetaMask is a [self-custodial](/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet) (non-custodial) wallet, we won't be able to help you regain access in such cases. After reinstalling, you'll need to [restore your wallet](/managing-my-wallet/resetting-deleting-and-restoring/how-to-restore-your-metamask-wallet-from-secret-recovery-phrase) using your Secret Recovery Phrase.

For each old account that you had in your original installation, you must re-add it; see [here](/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-to-add-missing-accounts-after-restoring-with-secret-recovery-phrase) for details.

If the token you are looking for is not found using the Search method, then you will need to [add it as a Custom Token](/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/how-to-display-tokens-in-metamask).\
