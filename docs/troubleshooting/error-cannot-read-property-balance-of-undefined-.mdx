You may encounter this error message when you open MetaMask:

_Message: Cannot read property 'balance' of undefined_

_Code: TypeError_

We recommend you reset your account by following the instructions [here](/managing-my-wallet/resetting-deleting-and-restoring/how-to-clear-your-account-activity-reset-account). Before you do so, consult a member of the team by [getting in touch with Support](/getting-started/how-to-contact-metamask-support) â€” resetting an account should be avoided where possible. **Make sure you have your Secret Recovery Phrase backed up before you reset your account, as well as the seed phrases or private keys of any imported accounts. **

One thing to keep in mind after resetting your account is that your transaction activity history may default to none: this is because MetaMask stores your transaction history locally. Remember that all transaction history is on the blockchain, and can be [consulted on a block explorer](/managing-my-wallet/how-to-check-my-wallet-activity-on-the-blockchain-explorer). MetaMask being unable to retrieve your balance does not mean that your funds have been lost.
