MetaMask Swaps only displays quotes for potential swaps when there is sufficient liquidity on underlying markets. Generally, a few thousand dollars' worth of liquidity is required to mitigate price impact. Once a token has sufficient liquidity, it will be available.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/token-swaps/error-fetching-quote/Error_fetching_quote.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="Error fetching quote"
    />
  </div>
</div>

The message ("error fetching quote") you see suggests that there is no liquidity available for the token you want to swap.

You can always check [coingecko.com](https://www.coingecko.com/en), search for your token, then click the **Markets **tab to see where you could swap this token and where it can be traded.
