If you try to swap using MetaMask Swaps and your swap fails, you could see this error message on the block explorer:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/token-swaps/error-expiry_passed-after-a-swap/EXPIRY_PASSED.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="EXPIRY_PASSED.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

This happens either when:

- You waited too long in MetaMask to perform the swap, or;
- You submitted the swap right as the quotes were about to refresh.

Retry the attempted swap as normal, and you should no longer encounter the same error. If you do, [get in touch with Support](/getting-started/how-to-contact-metamask-support).
