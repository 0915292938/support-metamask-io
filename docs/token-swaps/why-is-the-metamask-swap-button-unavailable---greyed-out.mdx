#### Please note:

This article is for MetaMask swaps performed with the swap button within our app or extension. ** For all other swap inquiries, please contact the third-party swap system you used, as they will have a better understanding of their system's intricacies, nuances, and issues.**

:::

MetaMask Swaps is not available on every network. If it is available on a network, the button will allow you to proceed. The team is investigating options on a path forward for additional networks. If and when that time comes, you will automatically see it reflected in the app and extension.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/token-swaps/why-is-the-metamask-swap-button-unavailable---greyed-out/MetaMask_swap_button_greyed_out.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask swap button greyed out"
    />
  </div>
</div>

If you are on a network on which Swaps is available, but are unable to click the Swap button, try restarting your browser, or try a different network connection entirely. Sometimes toggling networks (switch from one network back to the network you were using) helps.
