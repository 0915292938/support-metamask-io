MetaMask Swaps automatically offers many tokens available on underlying decentralized exchanges. When tokens have liquidity on those systems, they will automatically become available on MetaMask Swaps. There are some tokens that are not approved on MetaMask Swaps, or do not work with our swaps.

If you do not see your token, check back later, or you can [get in touch with Support](/getting-started/how-to-contact-metamask-support) and we can investigate further.
