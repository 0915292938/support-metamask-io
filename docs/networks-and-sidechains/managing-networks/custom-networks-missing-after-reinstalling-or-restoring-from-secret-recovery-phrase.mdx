When you reinstall MetaMask, custom networks need to be re-added. This is because MetaMask essentially considers your wallet to be a completely new instance of the app, and will not retain any of the data that was previously stored locally â€” custom networks being one example.

You can easily re-add the networks that are missing using the instructions in the below articles:

- [Add a network using Chainlist](/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/add-a-network-using-chainlist)
- [How to add a custom network RPC](/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/how-to-add-a-custom-network-rpc).
