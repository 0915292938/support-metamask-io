Great news, Linea is live and native to MetaMask! This means that you can connect to Linea without having to add it to your network configuration.

To connect to Linea follow the steps below:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Mobile" label="Mobile">

1. Locate the current network drop-down at the top of the screen

2. Tap it to view your previously connected networks, and then tap Linea to switch to it.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/how-to-connect-to-linea-on-metamask/MetaMask_connect_to_Linea_mobile.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask connect to Linea mobile"
    />
  </div>
</div>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Extension" label="Extension">

1. Select the drop-down arrow in the top left corner of the app. It will currently display the network you're connected to, such as 'Ethereum Mainnet', or any other you used last.

2. Scroll through the menu until you find the 'Linea Mainnet' network, then click on it to switch.

          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask connect to Linea extension"
    />
  </div>
</div>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Once I get connected to Linea, what can I do?

There's a lot going on! Follow some of [these guides](https://docs.linea.build/use-linea) to get started, and check out [the dapps that are already deployed to the network](https://goerli.linea.build/explore).

You can bridge to and from Linea using [MetaMask Portfolio's Bridge](/metamask-portfolio/bridge/how-to-use-the-bridge), and swap on Linea using [MetaMask Swaps](/token-swaps/user-guide-swaps).
