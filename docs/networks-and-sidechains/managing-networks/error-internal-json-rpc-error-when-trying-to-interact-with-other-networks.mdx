### If you are interacting with sidechains or custom networks, we highly recommend you read our user guide [here](/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/user-guide-custom-networks-and-sidechains).

If you get the error "Internal JSON-RPC error" while trying to interact with other networks, try the following:

- Ensure the network has been added correctly. See our [article on adding networks](/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/how-to-add-a-custom-network-rpc) to find out how to do this.
- Ensure you have enough native tokens from that network to pay for gas.
- Ensure you are using the latest version of the app or the extension.
