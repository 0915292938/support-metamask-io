#### _If you are using MetaMask in conjunction with Binance, we strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with [Binance's documentation on the topic](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html). That said, there are some technical details you **must understand in order to avoid losses**._

Specifically, **Binance is not just one platform**. It's not even just one blockchain. When people talk about Binance, they may be referring to any one of the following:

- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), _the centralized cryptocurrency exchange_
- _Its US-based equivalent_, [binance.us](https://www.binance.us/en/home)
- [The BNB Chain](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/all/binance-chain-blockchain-for-exchanging-the-world-304219301536473088), (formerly Binance Chain) _the blockchain which tracks BNB_
- [The BNB Smart Chain,](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain) (formerly Binance Smart Chain, still referred to as BSC by most) _designed to 'bring smart contract functionality to the Binance Ecosystem ', tracks tokens that comply with the BEP-20 standard and is compatible with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible networks_

The methods for moving assets between these different networks vary depending on what you are trying to move, where. **Not all assets can be moved freely between all chains.**

## What are you trying to do?

### Move assets between the Binance, or binance.us, centralized exchange and a wallet address via MetaMask

Recommendation: Follow [Binance's instructions](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/115003670492).

**Note that if you withdraw BNB as a BEP2 token, it may not function as intended, for example, in dapps on the BNB Smart Chain. **In order to access this functionality, you will need to withdraw your BNB as BEP20 tokens. Additional instructions for [withdrawing here](/networks-and-sidechains/binance/receiving-funds-from-binance), and [depositing to Binance here](/networks-and-sidechains/binance/transferring-assets-to-the-binance-exchange).

### Move assets between the BNB Smart Chain and another EVM-compatible network via MetaMask

Recommendation: Follow [Binance's instructions](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-recover-crypto-transferred-to-the-wrong-network-on-binance).

**Additionally, we strongly recommend that you use official bridges when transferring tokens between blockchains.** Additional instructions for [sending to BNB Smart Chain via MetaMask](/networks-and-sidechains/binance/sending-assets-to-binance-bnb-smart-chain) here, and instructions for [sending from BNB Smart Chain to a different blockchain](/networks-and-sidechains/binance/how-to-send-tokens-from-bsc-to-ethereum-or-other-chains) via MetaMask here.

**Have you sent funds from BSC to MetaMask, but you don't see the tokens**? We have instructions for that [here](/managing-my-tokens/moving-your-tokens/i-have-sent-funds-from-binance-smart-chain-to-metamask-but-i-dont-see-the-tokens-in-my-metamask-wallet).
