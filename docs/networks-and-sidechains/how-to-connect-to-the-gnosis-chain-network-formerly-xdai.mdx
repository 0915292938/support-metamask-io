**For an automatic process**, go to [Chainlist](https://chainlist.wtf/), search for Gnosis, and connect your wallet.

**For a manual process**:

Follow the steps found [here](/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/how-to-add-a-custom-network-rpc) to add a custom network. You can also head here and click 'Add to MetaMask' in the top-right corner to quickly add it.

If you need the custom network details to add it manually, use:

- Network Name: **Gnosis Chain**

- New RPC URL: [https://rpc.gnosischain.com](https://rpc.gnosischain.com/)

- Chain ID: **0x64** (the hexadecimal equivalent of 100; if you encounter issues, input 100 instead and retry)

- Symbol: **xDai**

- Block Explorer URL: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/)
