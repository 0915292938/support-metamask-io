Polkadot blockchain is **not an EVM-compatible** **network** and is currently **not supported in MetaMask**. We are hoping to facilitate support for Polkadot in the future through our Snaps plugin system.

See Polkadot's own information [here](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000168660-can-i-send-dot-to-metamask-or-mycrypto-wallet-).
