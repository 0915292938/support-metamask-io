If you've already been in touch with Support and have an open ticket, **contacting us again by any means does not mean your issue will get resolved sooner**. Our technical support team work through tickets chronologically and will be in touch to help you out as soon as possible.

**If you've only spoken to us through the chat window on this site, you do not have an open ticket**. Tickets are administered by email.

> What do we mean when we say 'support'? [See below](#metamask-support-structure).

In the meantime, you can log into our support platform, Zendesk, to check on the status of your ticket:

1. **Log into your Zendesk account on the MetaMask support page**. The URL should read: **_support.metamask.io/hc/[locale]_**. Make sure you're in the right place — if you're not on this domain, you may be on a fraudulent site, so don't enter any personal information! You should have received an email to create an account for the platform when your ticket was opened.
2. Find the account icon in the top right of the page. Click on it and hit 'My activities' in the drop-down menu:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/getting-started/how-to-check-the-status-of-an-open-support-ticket/Check_the_status_of_an_open_Support_ticket_1.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="Check the status of an open Support ticket MetaMask"
    />
  </div>
</div>

3. On this page you'll be able to see your open support tickets listed under the 'Requests' tab:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/getting-started/how-to-check-the-status-of-an-open-support-ticket/Check_the_status_of_an_open_Support_ticket_2.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="Check the status of an open Support ticket MetaMask"
    />
  </div>
</div>

This is the only place where you can check on your ticket status. Our Support Twitter account, for example, will not and cannot contact you on Twitter.

### [MetaMask Support structure]

MetaMask Support consists of three main elements: the helpdesk, technical support, and the Community page. All three are accessible via this site — our Support page. Typically, you might first interact with the Community or some articles on this page before contacting our helpdesk. Depending on your problem, helpdesk may elevate your case to technical support. **The tickets described in this article relate solely to support provided by the technical support team. **

Let's break this down. To start with, what is **technical support**?

We use this term for our staff who will help you with tickets via email, and usually concerning particularly complex issues or matters relating to security and loss of funds. In most cases, you cannot contact technical support about MetaMask without being referred.

**Technical support is distinct from helpdesk agents**. The latter handle the majority of Support cases, and you can get through to them through the [Start a Conversation button](/getting-started/how-to-contact-metamask-support) on our Support homepage after answering a few questions that help us gather details. The helpdesk team do not work via email, but solely through the window that opens when you click the Start a Conversation button.

Additionally, posting on our [Community page](https://community.metamask.io/) does not mean you have opened a ticket. However, the Community page is moderated, so you will receive a response, and potentially help from other community members.

If you originally got in contact with us through the conversation window, or you posted on the Community forum, this does not mean you have an open ticket. The steps described above therefore won't apply.
