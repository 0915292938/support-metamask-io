### **MetaMask will never send you a direct message. MetaMask will never ask you for your Secret Recovery Phrase.** **If someone does, they're probably trying to scam you.**

:::info[To speak to a member of our team:]

Head to the'start a Conversation' button on the homepage of this site. [It may take a moment or two to load](/getting-started/i-cant-access-the-start-a-conversation-button-on-the-support-page). You'll be guided through a few questions to see whether we can solve your problem straight away, and, if not, you'll be able to chat with a member of our team.

- **If you can't find an answer in these resources, click on the'start a Conversation' button on [https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us). **If the button doesn't appear or is broken, try turning off adblockers, as explained [here](/getting-started/i-cant-access-the-start-a-conversation-button-on-the-support-page).
  - If your request requires a little more investigation time, you can stay notified of your ticket status through MetaMask! Learn more about the [Web3 Ticketing Snap](/metamask-snaps/getting-started-with-the-web3-ticketing-dashboard).

When submitting a ticket or having a conversation with our support agent, it will help us if you **explain fully and clearly what has happened to you**. The types of details that our agents will ask for include the following:

- **Description** of what you were doing right before the error occurred (If relevant);
- Are you **able to repeat the error**?
- What are the **steps to reproduce the error**?
- The **networks, blockchains, and Dapps** you used
- Any **tokens or smart contracts** involved
- **State logs** ([How to Download State Logs](/managing-my-wallet/using-metamask/how-to-download-state-logs))
- **MetaMask version** (Click or tap on the identicon in the upper right hand corner > Settings > About)
- **Browser version / Mobile phone model**
- **Operating system** and version

### Remember, MetaMask [is a self-custodial wallet](/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet). We can't reset your password, we can't reverse transactions, we can't look up your Secret Recovery Phrase.
