When trying to [get support for MetaMask](/getting-started/how-to-contact-metamask-support), **always **be wary of who you're communicating with. A reliable rule of thumb is that **if anyone asks for your Secret Recovery Phrase, they are trying to scam you**.

**If you aren't sure whether or not something or someone is legitimate, ignore it**. To check whether something is genuine, get in touch with us via the'start a Conversation' button on our [Support homepage](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us) and we will advise.

### MetaMask representatives will only ever contact you via:

- **Email**, concerning [open tickets](/getting-started/how-to-check-the-status-of-an-open-support-ticket), from the domains _@metamask.io_ or _@metamask.zendesk.com_. If you haven't already given us your email to create a support ticket, we do not have it â€” remember [MetaMask does not ask for your email to create a wallet](/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet). If your email does not come from one of these addresses, ignore it; scammers have been known to target people with open tickets asking for Secret Recovery Phrases. We will never do this. Other common scam emails may involve asking you to follow a link to['verify' or 'confirm' your account](/privacy-and-security/will-metamask-ever-ask-me-to-verify-my-account), often with a sense of urgency. See here for more information: [I received an email claiming to be from MetaMask. Is it legit?](/privacy-and-security/staying-safe-in-web3/i-received-an-email-claiming-to-be-from-metamask-is-it-legit)
- Through our [Community platform](https://community.metamask.io/). As the rules at the top of our Community page detail, **we will never DM you offering support**. The [MetaMask subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/) is an extension of our Community and is also moderated by team members. However, as on any other platform, **we will never DM you on Reddit**.
- Through the **chat** accessed through the'start a Conversation' button on our [Support landing page](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us). This is our main channel for support communication.

It may be because of ad blockers or other browser features. See our article for more information: [I can't access the'start a Conversation' button on the Support page](/getting-started/i-cant-access-the-start-a-conversation-button-on-the-support-page)

MetaMask Support also has a [verified Twitter account](https://twitter.com/metamasksupport?lang=en), which is primarily to share important information to help out you and fellow users. **MetaMask will never contact you about your Support case on Twitter**.

### Here is a non-exhaustive list of ways MetaMask will *not *contact you:

- Discord
- WhatsApp
- Facebook
- Telegram
- Twitter
- Text/SMS
- Instagram

Any group that you find on Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram that claims to be an official MetaMask group should be considered at best a fan club, and at worst an attempt at social engineering with the goal of stealing peoples' crypto-assets.
