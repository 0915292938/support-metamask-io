If you are using MetaMask to access a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) such as Pancakeswap or Uniswap, and you see the error message "**Permissions request already pending please wait**", please try these workarounds, which should help you to reconnect:

- **Disconnect from the site** using the method explained [here](/third-party-platforms-and-dapps/disconnect-wallet-from-a-dapp) (available for both Mobile and Extension), then return to the dapp and click 'Connect wallet'. Afterwards, retry connecting to the dapp.
- If reconnecting using the above steps doesn't work, you could also try reinstalling MetaMask and [restoring](/managing-my-wallet/resetting-deleting-and-restoring/how-to-restore-your-metamask-wallet-from-secret-recovery-phrase). **Please ensure you have your [Secret Recovery Phrase](/getting-started/user-guide-secret-recovery-phrase-password-and-private-keys) and the seed phrases of any imported accounts safely backed up before uninstalling your wallet.**
