Usually, when you intend to connect MetaMask to a dapp in a desktop browser, a pop-up will appear in MetaMask asking you to confirm the connection.

**If nothing happens, the most common reason is because you have more than one browser-based wallet installed and active**. **You'll need to disable other wallets in order for MetaMask to work properly. **

To do this, head to your browser's extension manager and find the on/off toggle next to the other wallet's extension. It should look like this:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/third-party-platforms-and-dapps/i-cant-connect-metamask-extension-to-a-dapp-/MetaMask_extension_toggle.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask_extension_toggle.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

**Once you have disabled other wallets, reload the page**.

Depending on your browser, managing extensions can work a little differently. To find the correct page, copy the appropriate link into your address bar:

- **Chrome**: chrome://extensions
- **Brave**: brave://extensions
- **Firefox**: about:addons
- **Edge**: edge://extensions

If disabling other wallets doesn't work, get in touch with Support via the'start a Conversation' button on our homepage.
