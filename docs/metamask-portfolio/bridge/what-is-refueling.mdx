Refueling is a feature that ensures you receive some of the destination network's native token as part of your bridge transaction.

This means that you can transact immediately on the destination network without swapping, purchasing, or bridging specifically for native tokens.

To enable it, flick the toggle that appears on an eligible bridge transaction:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/metamask-portfolio/bridge/what-is-refuelling/MetaMask_Portfolio_bridge_refueling.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio bridge refueling"
    />
  </div>
</div>

:::info

The option will only appear if you're bridging to something other than the destination network's native token.

:::

When you refuel, you'll receive enough of the destination network's native token for two transactions or so, calculated based on the current cost of gas.
