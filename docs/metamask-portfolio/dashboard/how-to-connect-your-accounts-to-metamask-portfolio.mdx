#### Looking for how to import accounts into MetaMask?

This article is specifically about _connecting_ accounts to MetaMask Portfolio, at [portfolio.metamask.io](https://portfolio.metamask.io/). To learn how to import (add) accounts to MetaMask, see [here](/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-to-import-an-account).

:::

Connecting your accounts is simple, but the exact flow depends on whether it's the first time you've used the platform, or whether you already have an account (or several) connected.

## If you're a new user:

The first time you access the dapp, you'll see the option to add your MetaMask account(s) in the centre of the page. Click 'Connect MetaMask':

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/metamask-portfolio/dashboard/how-to-connect-your-accounts-to-metamask-portfolio/Metamask_Connect_Portfolio_Dapp_1.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="Metamask Connect Portfolio Dapp"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Follow the prompts to open MetaMask and confirm which accounts you'd like to connect:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/metamask-portfolio/dashboard/how-to-connect-your-accounts-to-metamask-portfolio/Metamask_Connect_Portfolio_Dapp_2.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="Metamask Connect Portfolio Dapp"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Once you confirm, the dapp will refresh after a brief pause, and you'll see your full crypto portfolio, encompassing the accounts you connected. You can view and manage your connected accounts at any time by heading to the settings menu by clicking the account icon in the top-right corner, and then selecting accounts:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/metamask-portfolio/dashboard/how-to-connect-your-accounts-to-metamask-portfolio/MetaMask_Portfolio_find_account_settings.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio find account settings"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## If you already have one or more accounts connected:

From the dashboard, find the account selector, located next to the 'Networks' menu in the top right of the dashboard area. When you click, you'll see a list of the accounts you've already added. To add another, click the button at the bottom of this list.

Now you'll be taken to the accounts settings page. From here, click on the 'Add account' button on the right-hand side:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/metamask-portfolio/dashboard/how-to-connect-your-accounts-to-metamask-portfolio/MetaMask_Portfolio_add_new_account.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio add new account"
    />
  </div>
</div>

You'll be prompted to connect your MetaMask or simply input the public address or ENS name of a wallet you want to watch:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/metamask-portfolio/dashboard/how-to-connect-your-accounts-to-metamask-portfolio/Metamask_Connect_Portfolio_Dapp_5.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="Metamask Connect Portfolio Dapp"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Follow the prompts to complete this process.
