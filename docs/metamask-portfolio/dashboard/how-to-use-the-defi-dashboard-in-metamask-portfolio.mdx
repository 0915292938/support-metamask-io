You can now view your DeFi ([decentralized finance](https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/finance-decentralized)) positions in the MetaMask Portfolio dashboard.

The DeFi dashboard is currently **available on Ethereum mainnet** only. Supported protocols include:

- Aave
- Curve
- Stargate.

Positions on any other network and any other protocols will not display. We'll expand support for the DeFi dashboard as soon as possible.

To access the DeFi dashboard, head to your dashboard page at [portfolio.metamask.io](https://portfolio.metamask.io/). If you already have your wallet connected to the dapp, you'll see a **DeFi tab** immediately underneath your portfolio value and alongside other tabs for tokens, NFTs, and transactions:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/metamask-portfolio/dashboard/how-to-use-the-defi-dashboard-in-metamask-portfolio/MetaMask_Portfolio_DeFi_tab.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio DeFi tab"
    />
  </div>
</div>

If you haven't already connected your wallet, follow [this guide](/metamask-portfolio/dashboard/how-to-connect-your-accounts-to-metamask-portfolio). If you just want to watch accounts, see [here](/metamask-portfolio/dashboard/how-to-watch-an-account-in-metamask-portfolio).

Once you're on the DeFi dashboard, you'll see your positions. Using [Vitalik](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin) as an example (I'm sure he won't mind), here's how your positions might look:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/metamask-portfolio/dashboard/how-to-use-the-defi-dashboard-in-metamask-portfolio/MetaMask_Portfolio_DeFi_positions.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio DeFi positions"
    />
  </div>
</div>

You can see a button linking to the relevant protocol (dapp) in the first column, and then others that show the name of the position, its type, holder address, and its value.
