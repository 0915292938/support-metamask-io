**The MetaMask wallet and MetaMask Portfolio are separate** **software** and do not communicate directly with each other on the backend.

Here's some points to keep in mind:

- [Adding a token to MetaMask](/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/how-to-display-tokens-in-metamask) does not mean it is automatically displayed in MetaMask Portfolio's dashboard, and vice versa.
- If a token isn't appearing in your dashboard, it may be because it is not on a supported network, or isn't a supported token on one of those networks. (Currently supported networks include Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, OP Mainnet, Arbitrum, Fantom, and Linea). See [here](/metamask-portfolio/dashboard/i-cant-import-a-token-into-the-metamask-portfolio-dashboard-why-) for further information about adding tokens.
- If you see a token in MetaMask but not in your dashboard, try adding it using our instructions [here](/metamask-portfolio/dashboard/how-to-import-a-token-in-metamask-portfolio).
- If you see a token in your dashboard but not in MetaMask, add it by clicking the three dots next to the token and then 'Add to MetaMask', or by using [one of these methods](/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/how-to-display-tokens-in-metamask).
