You can now sell your crypto directly within MetaMask Portfolio or MetaMask Mobile. **This feature is only available for ETH on Ethereum Mainnet** for now, but we plan to add more tokens in the near future, so stay tuned.

_The availability of providers for selling crypto varies between countries/regions. If you're unable to sell crypto in MetaMask, see [here](/metamask-portfolio/sell/my-country-region-isnt-supported-for-selling-crypto) for some alternative options. _

## How does it work?

Selling crypto in MetaMask involves using an aggregator of providers, making the process accessible, fast, scalable, and more secure.

When you enter how much ETH you want to sell, MetaMask's integrations with our vetted providers will spring into life, and fetch you quotes from each. These quotes automatically refresh to get the latest exchange rate from the providers, to account for the fluctuations in crypto prices, ensuring you have real-time visibility of market prices.

Since you input your region and currency during the process, the quotes you're presented with are automatically configured for your circumstances: so no need to worry about whether you'll be able to use the available withdrawal methods in your region, or whether your region is supported by that provider. If it appears on the quote list, you will be able to transact as quoted. Easy.

## How do I use it?

1. Head to [MetaMask Portfolio](https://portfolio.metamask.io/) and connect your wallet. You can access the page directly from MetaMask Extension by clicking the 'Buy/Sell' button, or sell in MetaMask Mobile without leaving the app:

<TabItem value="Extension" label="Extension">

  <div class="img-small">

        require("../../../img/metamask-portfolio/sell/how-to-sell-your-crypto-assets-for-fiat-currency-in-metamask/MetaMask_buy_sell_icon_locate.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask buy sell icon locate"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Go to the 'sell ' tab and, if it's your first time, click 'Get started ':

<TabItem value="Mobile" label="Mobile">

Tap the wallet actions button on your homepage, and then tap'sell'

        require("../../../img/metamask-portfolio/sell/how-to-sell-your-crypto-assets-for-fiat-currency-in-metamask/MetaMask_Portfolio_sell_mobile.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio sell button mobile"
    />
  </div>
</div>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

2. If you're a first-time user, you must select your region. If you've used this feature before, the app skips this step and uses the region you selected last time, which is saved in local storage.

   From the drop-down menu, search or scroll until you find the **country where your bank account is registered.** US users will then be able to select their state.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">

        require("../../../img/metamask-portfolio/sell/how-to-sell-your-crypto-assets-for-fiat-currency-in-metamask/MetaMask_Portfolio_select_region.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio select region"
    />
  </div>
</div>

If your region is not currently covered by at least one of our providers, we'll let you know at this point. You can read more about other ways to sell crypto [here](/metamask-portfolio/sell/my-country-region-isnt-supported-for-selling-crypto).

          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio unsupported region"
    />
  </div>
</div>

3. Input **the amount** of ETH you want to sell and **choose your preferred quote** :

          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio choose amount and quote"
    />
  </div>
</div>

4. you'll be taken to the provider's website, where you may have to complete **KYC** if you've never used their service before, and connect your bank account.

5. Return to Portfolio and click on the'send ETH' button**:**

          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio confirm send to provider"
    />
  </div>

## FAQs

<details>
<summary>What networks are supported?</summary>
<div>

Selling your ETH is only possible on Ethereum Mainnet for now.

If you have ETH on other networks that you 'd like to sell, you can always bridge it to Ethereum Mainnet using the [Bridge feature](/metamask-portfolio/bridge/how-to-use-the-bridge) in MetaMask Portfolio, and go from there.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What providers are available?</summary>
<div>

- Transak
- MoonPay
- Sardine
- Banxa

We're always working to integrate new providers, subject to rigorous security and reliability checks.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What tokens are supported?</summary>
<div>

Only ETH for now.

If you want to sell any other tokens, you could swap them to ETH first, and then sell. Use the **Swap** button in MetaMask or check our [guide](/token-swaps/user-guide-swaps) for more info.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What regions/countries are covered?</summary>
<div>

The supported regions are the US, UK and parts of Europe.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where will I receive my cash?</summary>
<div>

In the same bank account you added on the provider's website.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does MetaMask make money from this?</summary>
<div>

MetaMask receives a 1% fee on every transaction from providers, similar to when you buy crypto using MetaMask.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to pay gas fees for this process</summary>
<div>

Yes. Since selling your ETH to the preferred provider occurs on Ethereum Mainnet, you'll need to pay a gas fee in ETH. This will be deducted from your total ETH balance.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How long before I receive my cash?</summary>
<div>

To get your fiat currency in your bank account, you must first execute a transaction on-chain, to send your ETH to the provider you chose. Then the provider sells the ETH according to the provided quote and sends the cash to your bank account.

It also depends on the payment method used: for SEPA (Europe) and Faster Payments (UK), the cash could be received as soon as the provider completes processing the order, but for the US, you might have to wait 1-3 business days.

If you notice the status of your order is 'Complete ' in MetaMask Portfolio, but the cash is still not reflected in your bank account within a few days, we recommend you contact the provider's support team directly.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What do I do if my transaction fails?</summary>
<div>

Since MetaMask does not execute your order, the provider will likely be better placed to support than our team. In these situations, we recommend you contact their support teams first.

For any issues you encounter with MetaMask itself (such as problems selecting your region or currency, or with the selling process), [get in touch with MetaMask Support](/getting-started/how-to-contact-metamask-support) via the'start a Conversation' button on the Support page. If you're facing problems using a provider's platform, such as withdrawal destinations, or KYC, we recommend you get in touch with their support teams directly.
