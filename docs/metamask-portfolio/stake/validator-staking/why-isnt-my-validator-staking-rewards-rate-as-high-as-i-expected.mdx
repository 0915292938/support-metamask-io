The APR you see in the MetaMask validator staking UI is variable.

This is an expected feature of ETH staking, for two reasons:

- **Block proposal**: One of the main responsibilities for validators—and, therefore, main sources of rewards—is to propose blocks, but this task is assigned randomly. As a result, the rewards generated by any single validator or group of validators cannot be predicted in advance. The randomness inherent in block proposal rewards is smoothed out over time. Over a 6-12 month period, all Ethereum validators will propose an approximately equal number of blocks, and the APR they generate will be closer to average.
- **Execution layer rewards**: Execution layer rewards comprise MEV proceeds and priority fees paid for any transactions included in a block that the validator proposes. Both of these are variable.

This is why your actual rewards rate may not be as high as the average validator performance shown in-app as "Rewards rate", which is based on the performance of MetaMask Staking validators collectively.

:::info[Consensus layer rewards]

Block proposal rewards are one of two main sources of consensus layer rewards — the other is block attestation rewards. As every single block must be validated (attested) by every validator, attestation occurs at regular intervals. Unlike block proposal rewards, block attestation rewards are therefore stable and predictable.
