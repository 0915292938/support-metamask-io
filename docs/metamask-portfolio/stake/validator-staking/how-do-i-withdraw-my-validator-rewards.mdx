You can claim validator rewards manually at any time. They 'll need to be claimed for each validator individually, but we 're exploring options to allow you, in the future, to claim all of your rewards at once.

Please note that rewards can only be withdrawn to the same account you staked with.

Here's how:

1. From the validator staking homepage, click on the three vertical dots on the right of the validator whose rewards you want to claim (make sure there are some rewards shown in the 'Available rewards ' column, or you won 't be able to claim anything):

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../../img/metamask-portfolio/stake/validator-staking/how-do-i-withdraw-my-validator-rewards/MetaMask_Portfolio_validator_stake_rewards.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio validator stake rewards"
    />
  </div>
</div>

2. From the options available, select 'Withdraw rewards only ':

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../../img/metamask-portfolio/stake/validator-staking/how-do-i-withdraw-my-validator-rewards/MetaMask_Portfolio_withdraw_rewards_only.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio withdraw rewards only"
    />
  </div>
</div>

3. Now you'll see the 'Review withdrawal ' screen. Review the details, and click 'Confirm ' if you're happy to proceed. When you withdraw from a validator for the first time, you'll need to sign an additional transaction to prepare your withdrawal address. Thereafter, you can claim with a single transaction per validator.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../../img/metamask-portfolio/stake/validator-staking/how-do-i-withdraw-my-validator-rewards/MetaMask_Portfolio_review_rewards_claim.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio review rewards claim"
    />
  </div>
</div>

After a short wait whilst the transaction is picked up and confirmed, you should see a 'Transaction complete ' message appear on screen, and the rewards should be available in your account.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../../img/metamask-portfolio/stake/validator-staking/how-do-i-withdraw-my-validator-rewards/MetaMask_Portfolio_rewards_transaction_complete.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio rewards transaction complete"
    />
  </div>
</div>
