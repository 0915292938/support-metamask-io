MetaMask and Consensys are committed to client diversity. Towards this end, Consensys is developing an execution layer (EL) client ([Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/)) and a consensus layer (CL) client ([Teku](https://consensys.io/teku)).

The Consensys Staking infrastructure powering MetaMask validator staking uses an algorithm to distribute validators across multiple execution layer and consensus layer clients.

**On the consensus layer**, we run two clients for validator duties: Teku and Lighthouse. Our algorithm allocates new validators to Teku or Lighthouse in order to maintain a 50%-50% split between Teku and Lighthouse across the entire platform.

**On the execution layer**, we run two clients for validator duties: Geth and Besu. 58% of validators use Besu, and 42% use Geth.

:::info

Currently, Geth represents a 'supermajority', and is used by more than two-thirds of validators across the Ethereum network. Validators running supermajority clients may face greater risk in the event of a bug in the execution client software than validators running a minority client.

Although Consensys already contributes to client diversity by using a mix of clients, we will continuously evaluate how Geth adoption evolves throughout the ecosystem. If Geth usage does not continue to fall ecosystem-wide, we will take additional actions to further reduce our Geth adoption.

:::

Beyond client diversity, Consensys Staking validators are distributed across two clouds (Azure, AWS) and six regions (two each in the US, Europe, and Asia).
