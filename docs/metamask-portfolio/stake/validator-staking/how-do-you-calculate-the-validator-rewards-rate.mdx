'Rewards ' refers to the payment Ethereum validators receive from the protocol in return for their contributions to keeping the network secure, stable, and operational. They comprise:

- A base rate, paid to validators who attest blocks. This is frequent because it happens at every block, and;
- Additional rewards paid to the one validator who was randomly selected to propose the block.

Since the responsibility for block proposal is assigned to validators randomly, and the rewards for proposing a block depends on the transactions included in the specific block, the amount of rewards earned when proposing a new block varies. If your validator's rewards rate on MetaMask Staking is higher or lower than expected, it's most likely because of this natural variation.

The way we represent your rewards rate varies depending on which stage of the validator process you're in:

- **If you haven 't staked yet**—or you're in the activation queue, waiting for your validator to become operational—the displayed rewards rate is based on the performance of Consensys Staking validators in the past week.
- **If you have already staked**, the rewards rate you see is the actual performance of your validator, with the 10% MetaMask fee already subtracted.
