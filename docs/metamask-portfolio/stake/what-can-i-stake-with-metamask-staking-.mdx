MetaMask Staking currently allows you to stake the following tokens, both on **Ethereum Mainnet**:

- ETH

  - [Pooled staking](/metamask-portfolio/stake/pooled-staking), through the Lido or Rocket Pool protocols
  - [Validator staking](/metamask-portfolio/stake/validator-staking), using the Consensys Staking protocol.

- MATIC through the Lido or Stader Labs protocols (**only available to users outside the United States**).
