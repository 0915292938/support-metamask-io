#### This information relates to pooled staking only

The information shown here relates to pooled staking â€” that is, staking through third-party protocols Lido, Rocket Pool, and Stader Labs, and through which you receive liquid staking tokens. For information about validator staking terms, see the [validator staking section](/metamask-portfolio/stake/validator-staking).

:::

**Estimated rewards** is the percentage of annual rewards you are predicted to receive, subject to change, based on a provider's performance over the last week, as calculated by each provider's API. To learn more about estimated rewards, see [here](/metamask-portfolio/stake/pooled-staking/how-do-estimated-rewards-work-).

**Network control** is the estimated percentage of staking validators associated with each provider, calculated using a mix of on-chain data and third-party APIs.

**Popularity** is an estimate of the fiat value of ETH and MATIC staked with each provider. This is calculated using the same method of available on-chain data and third-party APIs.
