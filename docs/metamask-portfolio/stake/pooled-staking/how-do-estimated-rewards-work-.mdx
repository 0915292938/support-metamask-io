#### Looking for rewards information for validator staking?

This article describes rewards for pooled staking. See [here](/metamask-portfolio/stake/validator-staking/how-do-you-calculate-the-validator-rewards-rate) for details of rewards for validator staking.

:::

When viewing your holdings, you'll see two variants of estimated rewards which are calculated slightly differently:

- **Estimated lifetime rewards**: Lifetime rewards are an estimate of how many rewards you 've received from the staking provider, calculated using a mix of on-chain data and third-party APIs. It may include rewards you may have received from holdings acquired outside of MetaMask Staking.
- **Estimated current rewards**: Current rewards is the percentage of annual rewards you are predicted to receive, subject to change, based on a provider's performance over the last week, as calculated by each provider's API.
