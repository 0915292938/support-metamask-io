#### Note:

MetaMask Staking is currently only supported on **Ethereum mainnet**.

:::

Staking with MetaMask is a fairly straightforward process. However, there are two options to choose from:

- If you want to stake less than 32 ETH, continue on to the instructions below, for **pooled staking**.
- If you have 32 ETH or more and you're interested in having your own validator(s), check out our **validator staking** guide, [here](/metamask-portfolio/stake/validator-staking/how-do-i-stake-with-validator-staking).

Follow the steps below to get started and receive rewards:

1. Head on to [MetaMask Portfolio](https://portfolio.metamask.io/) and click on'stake'. You can select which token you want to stake: **ETH** or **MATIC** (MATIC staking is currently available only to users outside the United States).

        require("../../../../img/metamask-portfolio/stake/pooled-staking/how-do-i-stake-with-metamask-staking/MetaMask_Portfolio_select_token_for_stake.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio select token for stake"
    />
  </div>
</div>

2. After selecting the token you wish to stake, choose the staking provider.

3. Enter the amount of ETH or MATIC tokens that you want to stake and click 'Review'.

        require("../../../../img/metamask-portfolio/stake/pooled-staking/how-do-i-stake-with-metamask-staking/MetaMask_Portfolio_review_stake.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio review stake"
    />
  </div>
</div>

4. Review the details of your stake and click the 'Confirm' button once you're ready.

      src={
        require("../../../../img/metamask-portfolio/stake/pooled-staking/how-do-i-stake-with-metamask-staking/MetaMask_Portfolio_confirm_stake.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio confirm stake"
    />
  </div>
</div>

5. Wait a few moments while your transaction is in progress. Once the transaction is complete, you'll see a screen like the one below:\

        require("../../../../img/metamask-portfolio/stake/pooled-staking/how-do-i-stake-with-metamask-staking/MetaMask_Portfolio_stake_transaction_complete.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio stake transaction complete"
    />
  </div>

#### Tracking your assets

You can track your staked tokens anytime, under 'Your Holdings'. The right-most card shows an active stake:

  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../../img/metamask-portfolio/stake/pooled-staking/how-do-i-stake-with-metamask-staking/MetaMask_Portfolio_staking_your_holdings.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Portfolio staking your holdings"
    />
  </div>
</div>
