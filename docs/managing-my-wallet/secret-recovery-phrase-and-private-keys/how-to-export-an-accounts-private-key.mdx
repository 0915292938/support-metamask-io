#### Warning!

Exporting your account could be risky as it displays your private key in clear text. To avoid possible loss of funds, **make sure no one else sees or is able to capture a screenshot while you retrieve your private key**. Many phishing campaigns ask for your private key to gain access to your account. You should **never share your private key with anyone**, including the MetaMask team. No MetaMask representative, including our Support team, will ever ask for your private key, regardless of the context. If someone does ask for your private key, assume they are trying to scam you, and **do not** hand it over.
