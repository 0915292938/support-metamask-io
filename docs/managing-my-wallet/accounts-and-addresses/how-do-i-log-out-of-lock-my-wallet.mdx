Remember: MetaMask isn't like a traditional website, where you're _logging in_ to a remote server. Rather, MetaMask stores your Secret Recovery Phrase, private keys, and a certain amount of information about how you use MetaMask (the'state logs') on your local device, so that whenever you want to carry out an operation on a blockchain, your SRP and private keys are ready to be used.

In this sense, you don't _log out_ of MetaMask, but you can _lock_ the application, so that you'll have to re-enter your password or biometrics to log back in.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Extension" label="Extension">

Click the three vertical dots in the top right of your wallet, and then select 'Lock MetaMask' from the dropdown menu:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-do-i-log-out-of-lock-my-wallet/MetaMask_lock_wallet_extension.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask lock wallet extension"
    />
  </div>
</div>

You can also set an auto-lock, which you can find in Settings > Advanced**: **

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-do-i-log-out-of-lock-my-wallet/MetaMask_adjust_autolock_settings_extension.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask adjust autolock settings extension"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Here you can set a timer in minutes after which the wallet will be locked.

You can also add an extra layer of security by adding a hardware wallet. Refer to **[this article](/privacy-and-security/hardware-wallet-hub)** on hardware wallet integration.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Mobile" label="Mobile">

To manually lock the app, tap the gear icon in the tab to access settings, and then scroll to the bottom. Tapping 'Lock' will prompt a confirmation message:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-do-i-log-out-of-lock-my-wallet/MetaMask_lock_wallet_mobile.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask lock wallet mobile"
    />
  </div>
