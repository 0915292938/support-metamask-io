Address nicknames allow you to get a better grasp of the address you are about to interact with. When making a transaction, you can now click on an address to see suggested nicknames or add your own.

## How can I add an address nickname?

Whenever you send a transaction or interact with a smart contract, you’ll notice that MetaMask might display the receiving address in one of three ways;

- Highlighted in gray, indicating that the address does not yet have a nickname set;
- Automatically displayed with a nickname, indicating that the address was already recognized by MetaMask, such as a token contract;
- An address nickname set by yourself.

If you are interacting with an address that MetaMask does not automatically recognize, and the address is highlighted in gray, you can provide a nickname so you can easily recognize it in the future.

        require("../../../img/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/what-are-address-nicknames/MetaMask_unrecognized_address.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="Unrecognized address"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Click the address, and find the ‘Nickname’ field. Enter a nickname of your choosing. MetaMask might also provide some suggested nicknames, which are fetched from sources such as Etherscan, ENS, or Lens.

          .default
      }
      alt="Setting an address nickname"
    />
  </div>

After clicking ‘Save’, you will notice that the address that was previously highlighted in gray, is now replaced with your newly set nickname.

          .default
      }
      alt="Previously unknown address now shows up with an address nickname"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Some addresses, such as those of token contracts, might automatically display a default nickname. If the default nickname doesn’t suit you, you can always rename it to something different.

          .default
      }
      alt="Address that was already automatically recognized by MetaMask"
    />
  </div>
</div>

You will be able to see the address nickname during any new transaction you make, as well as in the ‘Activity’ tab of your account.

We highly recommend setting up a nickname for each address you often interact with; this way, you’ll be certain that you’re interacting with the address that you meant to interact with.

## Can I change an address nickname?

Yes! Simply click on the nickname and change away. After saving the new nickname, it will immediately be reflected.
