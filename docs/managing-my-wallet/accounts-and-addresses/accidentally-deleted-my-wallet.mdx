Firstly: **it is impossible to delete the accounts in your wallet**. Once they are created, they exist on the blockchain forever. See [here](/managing-my-wallet/resetting-deleting-and-restoring/how-can-i-delete-my-metamask-wallet).

However, it _is_ possible to delete the MetaMask extension in your browser, or remove the mobile app. If you do this, you'll need to redownload it, and then follow one of these two options:

- Restore your wallet [using the Secret Recovery Phrase](/managing-my-wallet/resetting-deleting-and-restoring/how-to-restore-your-metamask-wallet-from-secret-recovery-phrase).
- If you don't have your Secret Recovery Phrase, you may be able to retrieve it if you still have access to the device on which you were using MetaMask. See [here](/managing-my-wallet/secret-recovery-phrase-and-private-keys/can-i-access-my-accounts-without-my-secret-recovery-phrase).
