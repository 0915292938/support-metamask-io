Across this support page, we refer to your **wallet** and **account(s)** as separate items.

The distinction is not immediately clear, but is important for understanding how MetaMask works, its structure, and what you can and can't do with wallets and accounts.

#### tl;dr

'Wallet' describes the MetaMask software you're using. 'Account' refers to a public-private key pair.

Your wallet doesn't have an address; an account within it does. Instead, a MetaMask wallet is a software tool that allows you to manage and access accounts.

You can derive more than one account from a Secret Recovery Phrase (seed phrase).

## What is a wallet?

**A wallet is a client (a piece of software) with which you manage your [accounts](#what-is-an-account).**

The confusion around web3 wallets often stems from the term itself and how it relates to our non-technological, everyday-life understanding of it. A physical wallet holds cash and cards; in web3, **your wallet does not contain your assets â€” your accounts do.**

Instead, we should imagine MetaMask and other wallet software as the kind of real-world, physical 'wallet' that holds an ID card or passport. The wallet itself is simply a tool for transporting around a means of proving your identity. MetaMask, accordingly, is principally a **tool for proving your identity in web3**. This is why we sometimes refer to MetaMask as a decentralized identity management tool: it's a way of signing transactions and messages to demonstrate that you are the holder of the private keys of your account(s).

## What is an account?

**An account is a public-private key pair derived from your Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP). **

**Your accounts in MetaMask are each represented by a public address** (the 'public' side of your key pair), which you may have seen referred to incorrectly as a 'wallet address'. There is no such thing: there is only an account address. Confusingly, many web3 services and protocols conflate wallets and accounts. This is unhelpful, particularly when navigating support issues such as [lost SRPs](/managing-my-wallet/secret-recovery-phrase-and-private-keys/can-i-access-my-accounts-without-my-secret-recovery-phrase), and [restoring](/managing-my-wallet/resetting-deleting-and-restoring/how-to-restore-your-metamask-wallet-from-secret-recovery-phrase) and [resetting wallets](/managing-my-wallet/resetting-deleting-and-restoring/how-to-reset-your-wallet) and [accounts](/managing-my-wallet/resetting-deleting-and-restoring/how-to-clear-your-account-activity-reset-account).

## What does this mean in practice?

- You don't have funds and assets in a wallet; you have them in your accounts. Your accounts, in turn, are managed using your wallet.
- When you share an Ethereum address, you're sharing an account address. There is no such thing as a wallet address.
