We are always interested in hearing how our users would like to use and improve MetaMask.

Please post your request to our [Community forum](http://community.metamask.io/). You can also access this in-app if you're using MetaMask Mobile. Simply tap the gear icon in the tap bar, scroll down, and then select 'Request a feature'.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/managing-my-wallet/using-metamask/how-to-suggest-a-feature-or-improvement/MetaMask_how_to_suggest_a_feature_or_improvement.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask how to suggest a feature or improvement"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Before you submit a new request, have a look to see if someone else hasn't already suggested it â€” in this case, it's better to upvote theirs rather than add another.

Rest assured there's a lot of behind-the-scenes development that goes on at MetaMask, but we're keen to hear and integrate user requests wherever feasible. Posts on the Community requests page are regularly considered by our developers.
