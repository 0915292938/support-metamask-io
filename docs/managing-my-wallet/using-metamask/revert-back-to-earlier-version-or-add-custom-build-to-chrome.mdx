<CustomLayout />

This is fairly advanced functionality, and isn't something you're likely to need to do unless you're a software developer, or unless a Support agent is directing you to do so. Proceed with caution.

Previous versions of MetaMask can be found [here](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/releases).

- Open `Settings` > `Extensions`.
- Alternatively, use the URL `chrome://extensions/` in your address bar
- Check "Developer mode" in the upper right-hand corner.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/managing-my-wallet/using-metamask/revert-back-to-earlier-version-or-add-custom-build-to-chrome/Chrome_developer_mode.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="Chrome developer mode"
    />
  </div>
</div>

- At the top, click `Load Unpacked`.
- Navigate to your custom or previous version `metamask-plugin/dist/chrome` folder.
- Click `Select`.

  <div class="img-large">

      src={
        require("../../../img/managing-my-wallet/using-metamask/revert-back-to-earlier-version-or-add-custom-build-to-chrome/MetaMask_manually_install_chrome.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask manually install chrome"
    />
  </div>
</div>

- Change to your locale via `chrome://settings/languages`
- Restart the browser and test the plugin in your locale

You now have the plugin, and can click 'inspect views: background plugin' to view its dev console.

Instructions for Firefox and Opera can be found [here](/managing-my-wallet/using-metamask/how-to-install-metamask-manually).
