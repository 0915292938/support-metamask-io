## Installing an Account Management Snap

You can install Account Management Snaps the same way as other Snaps; directly through a dapp that makes use of the Snap, or by using the [MetaMask Snaps Directory](https://snaps.metamask.io/). [Learn more about finding and installing Snaps](/metamask-snaps/how-to-install-a-snap).

Now that you’ve installed an Account Management Snap, head over to the dapp accompanied with the Snap; from there, you can set up your account, after which it will show up right within your MetaMask interface.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../../img/metamask-snaps/account-management/how-to-install-an-account-management-snap/MetaMask_Snaps_account.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask Snaps Account"
    />
  </div>
</div>

And you’re good to go! Using the new account created by the Snap, you can interact with dapps as you would with any other Ethereum account in MetaMask. Note that since you manage your account through the Snap, you might have to approve any transactions in the dapp accompanying the Snap. You might also have to approve transactions through a companion mobile app.
