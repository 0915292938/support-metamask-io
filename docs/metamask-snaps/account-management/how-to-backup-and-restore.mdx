Accounts added to your MetaMask instance by [Account Management Snaps](/metamask-snaps/account-management/what-are-account-management-snaps) are managed by the Snap, and work **separately** from your MetaMask Secret Recovery Phrase; your SRP will not allow you to recover accounts added by Account Management Snaps.

:::info

ðŸ’¡ Snaps that make use of [Interoperability](/metamask-snaps/what-are-interoperability-snaps) **do** generate accounts based on your Secret Recovery Phrase. This means that even if you were to reset your entire MetaMask instance, recover your MetaMask accounts using your Secret Recovery Phrase, and install the Interoperability Snap again, you would be able to see the same account(s) for the new network that you have previously generated.

:::

For Account Management Snaps, since the Snap manages the accounts, you will have to back them up using the dapp accompanied with the Snap; this procedure differs with each Snap. Some might instruct you to write down a Secret Recovery Phrase during the initial setup, some might allow you to reveal a Secret Recovery Phrase later on, and some might have other ways of backing up an account.

Check with the Snap what its backup options are. If you run into issues, we highly recommend contacting the team behind the Snap directly, as they will be able to assist you best.
