Account Management Snaps allow Snap creators to bring their own account management experiences to MetaMask.

## Introducing Account Management Snaps

Account Management Snaps can create and manage EVM accounts, and are added to your MetaMask instance completely separate from your Secret Recovery Phrase.

:::info

ðŸ’¡ Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) accounts are accounts that make use of the underlying technology of Ethereum, which is the EVM. This means that at this time, this feature does not yet support accounts for non-EVM networks, such as Bitcoin. If youâ€™d like to use non-EVM networks with MetaMask, consider taking a look at [Interoperability](/metamask-snaps/what-are-interoperability-snaps).

:::

This allows accounts to make use of custom functionality provided by the Snap. Keep in mind that Account Management Snaps might require a companion app installed on your mobile device. A couple of Snaps already exist that make use of Account Management, such as:

1. **Silent Shard**<br/> The team at Silence Laboratories has created an Account Management Snap that distributes the generation of a private key between MetaMask Extension and a companion mobile app.
2. **Safeheron**<br/> The Safeheron Snap makes use of a similar distributed key generation concept but uses two companion apps, and communicates over a Local area network (LAN). This means that no sensitive data is shared outside of your network.
3. **Capsule**<br/> The Capsule Snap allows you to create MPC wallets with an email in the MetaMask extension using an authenticator app or passkey.

Make sure to stay tuned as more Account Management Snaps become available. Head over to the [MetaMask Snaps Directory](https://snaps.metamask.io/) to find Snaps available to install today.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

1. **What is the difference between Account Management Snaps and Interoperability Snaps?**<br/> Account Management Snaps can create accounts that are added to your MetaMask interface, and are EVM-based. These accounts are not tied to your Secret Recovery Phrase. If you reset your MetaMask instance, you will lose access to these accounts unless you back them up manually. Interoperability Snaps bring support for new blockchain networks and protocols. While new accounts for networks can be created, they do not directly show up in the MetaMask interface at this time. Additionally, accounts created with Interoperability Snaps are connected to your Secret Recovery Phrase; make sure to back it up safely.

MetaMask Snaps Account Management is just one category of Snaps that are available today; learn more about [Interoperability](/metamask-snaps/what-are-interoperability-snaps) to add support for new blockchain networks and protocols to your MetaMask experience, or [Security Snaps](/metamask-snaps/what-are-security-snaps) that provide you with additional information before youâ€™re about to submit a transaction.
