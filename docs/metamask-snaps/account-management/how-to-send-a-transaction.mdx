Sending transactions with accounts added by Account Management Snaps works essentially the same as regular accounts in MetaMask; you can receive funds, transfer assets to other addresses, and interact with your favorite DeFi protocols. However, there might be a few additional steps when interacting with Account Management Snaps;

Typically, when you initiate a transaction with a ‘regular’ MetaMask account, meaning one that is not managed by an Account Management Snap, you can instantly approve the transaction to be sent using the MetaMask interface. These transactions would happen in a **synchronous** manner.

Accounts that are managed by an Account Management Snap are **asynchronous**, and additional approval for transactions is often required through the Snap’s companion dapp, or mobile app.

This flow can differ for each Snap, and it is best to familiarize yourself with each individual Account Management Snap to get the most out of it.
