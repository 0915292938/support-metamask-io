MetaMask Snaps introduces a whole new level of customization and extended functionality to MetaMask. However, there might be times when you no longer need a specific Snap.

## Remove a Snap

In this guide, we 'll walk you through the steps to remove a Snap from your MetaMask instance.

1. To begin, look for the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner of your MetaMask window. Click on these dots to reveal a drop-down menu.

2. From the drop-down menu, select 'settings. ' This will open a new window where you can manage your MetaMask settings.

3. Click on 'snaps ' to access a list of all Snaps currently installed in your MetaMask instance.

      src={
        require("../../img/metamask-snaps/how-to-uninstall-a-snap/MetaMask_Snap_settings.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask_Snap_settings.gif"
    />
  </div>
</div>

4. Scroll through the list of installed Snaps to find the specific one you wish to remove. Once located, click on the Snap's name to view its info and settings.

          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask_Snap_installed_list.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

5. After clicking the Snap, you will see additional information about it, such as its permissions and connected websites.\
   \
   At the bottom of the Snap's details, you will find the 'Remove snap ' button. Click this button to remove the Snap.

6. A confirmation window will appear, asking if you are sure you want to remove the Snap. To proceed, click 'Remove snap ' in the prompt.

      src={
        require("../../img/metamask-snaps/how-to-uninstall-a-snap/MetaMask_Snap_uninstall.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask_Snap_uninstall.gif"
    />
  </div>
</div>

7. That's it! You 've now successfully uninstalled the Snap from your MetaMask. You 're always free to re-install the Snap if you want to.
