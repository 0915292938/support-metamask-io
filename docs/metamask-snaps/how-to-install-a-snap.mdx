MetaMask Snaps allow anyone to infinitely expand on MetaMask's functionality, such as adding [insights on your transactions](/metamask-snaps/what-are-security-snaps), support for [other blockchain protocols](/metamask-snaps/what-are-interoperability-snaps), or adding [notifications](/metamask-snaps/what-are-communication-snaps).

Are you new to MetaMask Snaps? Be sure to check out our guide on [Getting started with MetaMask Snaps](/metamask-snaps/getting-started-with-metamask-snaps)!

## Explore Snaps

Navigate to the [MetaMask Snaps Directory](https://snaps.metamask.io/?utm_source=metamaskSupport&utm_medium=knowledge-base&utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_content_none) for a comprehensive catalog of currently accessible Snaps. Select one that seems interesting to you, and click 'Install Snap ' to get started!

Dapps can also directly prompt you to install their accompanying Snap. For instance, a decentralized exchange (DEX) could prompt you to install their Snap, allowing them to automatically [notify](/metamask-snaps/what-are-communication-snaps) you right within MetaMask once your order has been fulfilled.

## Install a Snap

Luckily, installing a Snap is no difficult feat; here's a step-by-step.

1. Whenever a dapp requests you install a Snap or you choose to download a Snap from the [MetaMask Snaps Directory](https://snaps.metamask.io/?utm_source=metamaskSupport&utm_medium=knowledge-base&utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_content_none), you will be prompted with a connection request.\

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/metamask-snaps/how-to-install-a-snap/MetaMask_Snap_connection_request.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask_Snap_connection_request.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Take a moment to review the details provided in the connection request and ensure that the right domain is prompting you. If all seems well, click 'Connect ' to continue.

2. A new screen will appear, presenting the permissions required by the Snap. These permissions range from requesting internet access to controlling keys for other blockchain networks.

  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/metamask-snaps/how-to-install-a-snap/MetaMask_Snap_install_permissions.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask_Snap_install_permissions.gif"
    />
  </div>
</div>

**Carefully review each permission listed on this screen.** If you're comfortable with the permissions requested, click 'Install ' to continue.

3. For some sensitive permissions, you might be prompted for additional confirmation. Carefully consider the permissions that the Snap is requesting. Tick all the requested permissions, and click 'Confirm. '

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/metamask-snaps/how-to-install-a-snap/MetaMask_Snap_permissions_warning.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask_Snap_permissions_warning.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

4. Success! The Snap is now installed successfully. Did you encounter an error? Take a look at our [guide on troubleshooting Snap issues](/metamask-snaps/how-to-troubleshoot-snap-issues).

          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask_Snap_installation_complete.png"
    />
  </div>

By following these steps, you're now well-equipped to embrace the power of MetaMask Snaps! Installing a Snap gives you access to additional functionalities and exciting features, but remember that it also comes with specific permissions that you must **carefully** review.

Happy exploring! ðŸš€
