Security Snaps introduce a new tab in the transaction prompt, allowing Snaps to provide important security info about a transaction you're about to submit.

## Introducing Security Snaps

Security Snaps take your transaction journey to the next level by enabling Snaps to offer essential transaction insights, such as (but not limited to!):

1. **Phishing database checks**Know if the recipient address is linked to any known phishing databases, giving you an extra hand in figuring out whether you might be interacting with a malicious address.
2. **Transaction simulations**A Snap could help you determine whether a transaction might succeed or fail and predict any state changes by simulating the transaction locally, or by using AI.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

Not every Snap offers insights on your transactions. Check individual Snap descriptions to see if they make use of insights. When installing a Snap, you can also see whether it provides transaction insights by checking the permissions it requests:

  <summary>Are there any privacy concerns when using Security Snaps?</summary>
  <div>
    {" "}
    Different types of Snaps access different information based on the permissions
    granted at installation. Any user data you share with a third-party-developed
    Snap will be collected directly by Snaps developers; MetaMask does not have access
    to this data. Only install Snaps from developers that you trust, and always check
    the privacy policy and terms of use of a Snap before installation.{" "}
