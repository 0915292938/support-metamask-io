By going to the settings of a Snap, you can view its details, such as a description, version number, and permissions it has access to. Additionally, you can (temporarily) disable it, view connected websites, or uninstall the Snap if needed.

## Accessing Snap settings

Follow these steps to view and customize the settings for a Snap that you have already installed in MetaMask.

1. To begin, look for the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner of your MetaMask window. Click on these dots to reveal a drop-down menu.

2. From the drop-down menu, select 'settings. ' This will open a new window where you can manage your MetaMask settings.

3. Click on 'snaps ' to access a list of all Snaps currently installed in your MetaMask instance.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/metamask-snaps/how-to-access-snap-settings/MetaMask_Snap_settings.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask_Snap_settings.gif"
    />
  </div>
</div>

4. Scroll through the list of installed Snaps to find the specific one whose settings you wish to view. Once located, click on the Snap's name to view its info and settings.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/metamask-snaps/how-to-access-snap-settings/MetaMask_Snap_installed_list.png")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask_Snap_installed_list.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

5. That's it! After clicking the Snap, you will be able to access and customize its various settings, such as connected websites, or view when and where you installed this Snap.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src={
        require("../../img/metamask-snaps/how-to-access-snap-settings/MetaMask_Snap_settings_scroll.gif")
          .default
      }
      alt="MetaMask_Snap_settings_scroll.gif"
    />
  </div>
</div>
